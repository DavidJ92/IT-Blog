## Description

This application allows users to create and engage with tech-related content. Users can store, comment on, edit, and delete posts via the dashboard. The homepage displays all posts, but accessing the dashboard or specific posts requires login or account creation. User authentication ensures secure access using session storage, cookies, and hashed passwords.

The project follows the MVC pattern, using Sequelize for ORM, Express for routing, and Handlebars for templating. Challenges included learning Handlebars and navigating routing and middleware syntax as a first-time full-stack developer. Despite initial challenges, the project was successfully completed after overcoming learning curves and understanding how different components interact.

## Installation

1. Clone the repo:
   git clone https://github.com/DavidJ92/IT-Blog

2. Open in VS Code. If you do not have VS code you must install it.

3. Using the terminal, install node.js v16. If you have homebrew, the command should look like the following (brew install node@16), however this may vary and the documentation should be consulted.

4. Once node.js v16 is installed, in the terminal, utilize the command npm init -y to initialize and create a package.json where project files will be stored.

5. Next, use the terminal to run the command npm i to install the dependencies associated with this application (developers may need to install dependencies directly from the command line).

   Commands to install each dependency:

   - Command for sequelize will be npm i sequelize
   - Command for mysql2 will be npm i mysql2
   - Command for express will be npm i express@4.18.2
   - Command for dotenv will be npm i dotenv
   - Command for nodemon will be npm i nodemon
   - Command for bcrypt will be npm i bcrypt
   - Command for bootstrap will be npm i bootstrap
   - Command for connect-session-sequelize will be npm i connect-session-sequelize
   - Command for express-handlebars will be npm i express-handlebars
   - Command for express-session will be npm i express-session
   - Command for jest will be npm i jest

6. Next, you will need to make sure you have an added .env file within the root directory of your repository, within which you will pass your environmental variables specifying the database name, your MySQL username, and your MySQL password. This will need to be completed before running the application, and will allow the connection.js file to utilize your environmental variables keeping your sensitive information protected.

7. If you do not have a MySQL account, you will need to create one (see https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-installation-excerpt/5.7/en/).

8. Once all dependencies are installed, you will need to create the database. To do this you will need to navigate to the directory db directory containing the schema.sql file. Once there, you will need to open up a MySQL shell using the command mysql -u root -p, where you will then be prompted to enter you password. Once your password is entered you will be in the MySQL shell.

9. Once in the MySQL shell you will then run the command source schema.sql. This will create the database.

10. Once the database has been created, you will then need to seed the database (this will also create the model structure for the tables within the database). To do this, navigate to the root directory and run the command npm run seed. This needs to be done from the root directory because the .env file lives within the root.

11. Once the database has been seeded, you will then be able to run the command npm start from the root directory to spin up the server. With nodemon installed, you will also be able to utilize the command npm run watch to keep the server spun up between code edits.

12. From there, you can utilize applications such as Insomnia to test the functionality of the routes within the program and make edits to both the front-end and back-end of the code base.


## Features

This application allows users to create accounts securely, with login information hashed and stored in a database for later validation. Visitors can browse the homepage or public feed without an account but need to sign up to access specific blogs or create posts. Once registered, users gain access to the dashboard, enabling them to store content, interact with other users' posts (e.g., leave comments), and manage their own posts by editing or deleting them.

## Usage Information


Interacting with this application is straightforward and entirely frontend-driven. Upon visiting the site, users encounter a public feed and a login button, which prompts them to either sign in or create a new account. Once logged in, users can seamlessly navigate the entire application, contributing and creating content effortlessly.
